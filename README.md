mchof - MultiCore Higher-Order Functions
===
\* note: this package name is only a placeholder ;)

Map-like higher-order functions such as ```lapply``` are a common part of the R user's vocabulary, and have efficient parallel implementations in packages like ```plyr``` and ```multicore```. This package provides parallel wrappers for other higher-order functions in vanilla R, such as ```Filter``` and ```Position```.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Filter</td>
        <td>mcFilter(cores=2)</td>
    </tr>
</table>
