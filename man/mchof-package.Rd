\description{
mchof (read: mc'hoff) provides convenient, consistent parallel implementations of several commonly used higher-order functions found in base R. Excellent parallel implementations of map-like functions exist in packages such as plyr and multicore, giving users better efficiency with little work on their part. This package aims to extend this speedup to people who use functions like Filter or Reduce in their code}
