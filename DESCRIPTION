Title: multicore higher-order functions
Description: mchof (read: mac'hoff) is a utility library that provides
    convenient, consistent parallel implementations of useful higher-order
    functions such as Filter, Fold, ZipWith and more. This package aims to let
    the user write terse, powerful functional programs that work the first time
    they are run.
