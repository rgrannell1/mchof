Title: mchof: multicore higher-order-functions
Description: mchof (read: mc'hoff) provides convenient, consistent parallel
    implementations of several commonly used higher-order functions found in
    base R. Excellent parallel implementations of map-like functions exist in
    packages such as plyr and multicore, giving users better efficiency with
    little work on their part. This package aims to extend this speedup to
    people who use functions like Filter or Reduce in their code.
